# Netscape Navigator Redux (Alpha)
**Netscape Navigator Redux** is a fork of Responsively, aiming to serve as a modernized, feature-rich and lightweight version of the [web-browser that started it all.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape_Navigator)
It is designed with a developer-centric mindset, including utilities to make testing your own websites a breeze, such as the **Device Manager** which, assuming developer mode 
has been toggled on, will provide you with list of devices you can preview webpages on, including your very own!
